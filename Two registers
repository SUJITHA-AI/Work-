To transfer data between two registers in assembly language (e.g., for the 8086 microprocessor), you can use the MOV instruction. Here's an example program:

Example: Transfer data from AX to BX

; Assembly Program to Transfer Data Between Two Registers

section .text
    global _start   ; Entry point for the program

_start:
    MOV AX, 0x1234  ; Load data (0x1234) into AX register
    MOV BX, AX      ; Transfer data from AX to BX register

    ; Optional: Halt program (depending on environment)
    HLT             ; Stop execution (or use an OS-specific exit mechanism)

Explanation:

1. MOV AX, 0x1234: Loads the value 0x1234 into the register AX.


2. MOV BX, AX: Copies the contents of AX into BX.

Output

After executing the program:

AX (Source Register): 0x1234

BX (Destination Register): 0x1234


The value in AX has been successfully transferred to BX.
